An overview of my work

# [Project 1: ReneWind_Project: Project Overview](https://github.com/Ariyo347/ReneWind_Project/)
* Created a tool that to measure and predict degradation and future component capability (Recall 0.85 on test data) using ciphered datasets
* Optimized Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, XGBoost, Bagging Classifiers using Under/Oversampling, GridSearch CV and Hyperparameter tuning to reach the best model

# [Project 3:ReCell-Project: Overview](https://github.com/Ariyo347/ReCell-Project/)
* Created a tool that estimates or predicts the future normalized used price of used phones (Adj. R-squared ~ 0.84) which can be used to identify the best models to optimize profit and turnover
* Examined over 3,400 phones and 34 phone brands released between 2013 and 2020
